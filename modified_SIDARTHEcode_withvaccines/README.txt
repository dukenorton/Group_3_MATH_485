# MATLAB Code for epidemic simulations with the SIDARTHE-V model in the work
This folder includes the following Matlab scripts that can be used to reproduce the results in the article.

Amended code from [^1](https://github.com/dukenorton/Group_3_MATH_485/tree/main/SIDARTHE__code) by Andrew Olson, Carl Ingebretsen, Duke Norton, John Quillopo

* Sidarthe_Simulation.m
Matlab script to simulate the evolution of the SIDARTHE epidemic model, also compared to real data,
in the presence of containment/mitigation strategies (social distancing, lockdown, contact tracing and testing) that possibly vary over time.
The script contains the data and parameters to simulate the case study of COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, considered in the article,
but the parameters and the times at which they change can be adapted to suit any other case study.
