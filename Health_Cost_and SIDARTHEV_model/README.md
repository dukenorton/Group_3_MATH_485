# Running this code
The SIDARTHE-V model produces no figures, rather sending all of its forecasting data to the heatlh-cost/data-driven model. The user will want to run the [main.m](https://github.com/dukenorton/Group_3_MATH_485/blob/main/Health_Cost_and%20SIDARTHEV_model/Data-Driven-Model/main.m) file for the data-driven model. Upon doing so, the user is prompted to enter an entry for 'figura='. Here are the results noted in the code by each entry:

```
% input 0 to analyze all scenarios and plot summmary figures
% input 2,3,4 to plot figures 2,3,4
% input 12,13,16, 17 to plot extended-data-figures E2,E3,E6,E7
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Remark added on March 27: in the final version Figs. 2-3 have been 
% merged in Fig. 2, so that entering:
% "2" yields upper part of new Fig. 2
% "3" yields lower part of new Fig. 2
% "4" yields new Fig. 3
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
```
