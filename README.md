# Group3_initial
This is our initial "token". Can think of it as a link to our shared code.
Every new addition of code must be saved. When you save your new work you "commit".
The history of our commits are saved in a single place called our "repository".
Can "create a pull" to suggest edits/additions and wait for group approval before changing the main.
Can make new repositories for multiple versions of program to save individual commits.
    Ideally do this and change main only after consulting.
